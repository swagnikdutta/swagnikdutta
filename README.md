Hi, I'm Swagnik ðŸ‘‹


- I'm a backend engineer with a newfound interest in low-level programming.
- I mostly use Go and Python and have written a significant amount of JS in the past.
- Currently, I'm building [npctl](https://github.com/swagnikdutta/netprobe) which is a network-troubleshooting tool. It's an educational project to understand network programming and linux in general.
- I am an alum at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I focused on being a better programmer.
