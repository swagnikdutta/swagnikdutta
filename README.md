Hi, I'm Swagnik ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a backend engineer, comfortable with Go, Python, and JS.
- I'm interested in low-level programming, and currently, I'm building [npctl](https://github.com/swagnikdutta/netprobe) - a networking tool. It's an educational project aimed at understanding network programming and Linux.
- I am an alum at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I focused on being a better programmer.
